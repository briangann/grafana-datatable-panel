Column Sorting
* Sort table by any number of columns in ascending/descending order.

Table Options

#### Thresholding

##### Cell based threshold coloring

##### Cell based threshold value coloring

##### RowColumn threshold coloring

This option sets the row color to the "highest" threshold found for all cells in row.

It also sets the color for each cell according to the threshold (you can tell which columns actually exceeded the threshold).

This means - a row can have an overall color, with each cell indicating it's real threshold color.

![Thresholding with RowColumn2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/briangann/grafana-datatable-panel/master/src/screenshots/datatable-threshold-rowcolumn2.png)

##### RowColumn threshold coloring including row counter

Same as above, but with row counter included

  * Preset page sizes
  * Multiple paging types
  * Dropdown for page size

## TODO
* [+] Column is not working
* Add Additional Themes
    * Bootstrap:
        * Requires a modified .js file since it looks for "datatables.net" - need workaround
    * Foundation:
        * Requires a modified .js file since it looks for "datatables.net" - need workaround
        * Needs a new CSS that is "dark" for Grafana - the builtin is light
          http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/download.html/#customizeFoundation
    * JQueryUI ThemeRoller
        * Requires a modified .js file since it looks for "datatables.net" - need workaround

## Building

This plugin relies on Grunt/NPM/Bower, typical build sequence:

```

For development, you can run:

```
The code will be parsed then copied into "dist" if "jslint" passes without errors.


### Docker Support

A docker-compose.yml file is include for easy development and testing, just run
```
docker-compose up
```

Then browse to http://localhost:3000

### RPM

A spec file is included to facilitate RPM based deployments, to generate run
```
make rpm
```
